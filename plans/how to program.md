| JS | Node REPL | | Node REPL: math; variables | 
| Env | | | Setting up a project dir; How to think about projects on disk |
| Env | | | Setting up an editor; Atom; Sublime |
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Strings; Hello World by `console.log`; draw a static map | 
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Functions 1: simple functions; `double()`; turn counter | 
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Randomness 1: dice |
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Objects 1: objects as single objects; monsters |
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Functions 2: state-parameterized functions; `double()`; health counters | 
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Objects 2: game items: simple weapons - daggers only |
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Functions 3: functions as members of objects; having weapons determine their damage | 
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Objects 3: objects as containers; moving the game global state into an object |
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Randomness 2: list selection - more than just daggers |
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Arrays; simple monster list |
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | `Array.map()`; acting over the monsters |
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Template strings; better `console.log`; screen log; game event messages | 
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | updating the player's position with function calls; redrawing the map | 
| JS | Node | node-rogue | Moving to using the code from a console environment | 
| JS | Node | node-rogue | Consuming keypresses; auto-updating the player's position; auto-redraw |

| JS | Node | node-rogue | Monster movement 1: completely random synced movement | 
| JS | Node | node-rogue | Monster movement 2: preventing impossible monster moves | 
| JS | Node | node-rogue | Monster movement 3: bee-lining |
| JS | Node | node-rogue | Monster movement 4: multiple movement brains: random, bee-line, sit-still |
| JS | Node | node-rogue | Basic conflict: you hit them, they die | 
| JS | Node | node-rogue | Better conflict: hit points; they fight back; missing | 
| JS | Node | node-rogue | Colors; `colors` JS module; Installing modules with `npm`; color message line |
