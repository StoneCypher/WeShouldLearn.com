| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Objects 1: objects as single objects; monsters |
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Functions 2: state-parameterized functions; `double()`; health counters | 
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Objects 2: game items: simple weapons - daggers only |
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Functions 3: functions as object members; weapons determining damage | 
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Objects 3: objects as containers; moving the game global state into an object |

| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | `Array.map()`; acting over the monsters |
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | Template strings; better `console.log`; screen log; game event messages | 
| JS | Node REPL | node-rogue | updating the player's position with function calls; redrawing the map |

| JS | Node | node-rogue | Monster movement 4: multiple movement brains: random, bee-line, sit-still |
| JS | Node | node-rogue | Basic conflict: you hit them, they die | 
| JS | Node | node-rogue | Better conflict: hit points; they fight back; missing |
